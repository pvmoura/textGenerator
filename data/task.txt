Your task is to write a program that generates random text, based on a
continually updating set of sample input.

Whenever a new file whose name ends with ".txt" is put into the
directory where the program is running, the program should read in the
content of the file (assume that it is just text), stripping out
punctuation and ignoring case (you can assume that you only need to
deal with letters in the latin alphabet, so A-Z, a-z), and then
incorporating the words that remain into the programs storage.

Your program is free to delete the file as soon as it reads it. After
each file is read, it should generate a 100 word paragraph, composed
of 10 sentences that each have 10 words each (and are capitalized /
end with a period).

The words that make up the sentences should be generated randomly
according to the frequency of the words that have appeared in all of
the input that has been read so far.

The paragraph should be printed out to the screen, where each line is
no longer than 80 characters, but words are never broken across lines.
Your program should run forever, and keep repeating the above whenever
a file is added to the directory.

An example input is included as "corpus1.txt"; a possible run for
adding that file could be what follows. Obviously each time it runs, a
different output can result.
